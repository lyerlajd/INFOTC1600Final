# Converting Decimal to Binary and Back Again
## By James Lyerla

## Intro
Converting from decimal values to binary or the other way around all comes down to knowing what base each number system is in. Decimal values are base 10 and binary values are in base 2. A number in base 10 means that there are 10 different symbols that can go in each digit of a number, and that each digit is a symbol times 10 to a different power. For example, 37 is 3 * 10^1 + 7 * 10^0. Each digit the power of 10 goes up by one. Decimal values work a similar way; each digit can be one of two symbols, and the powers are on 2s instead of 10s. For example 0101 is 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 or 5 in decimal.
